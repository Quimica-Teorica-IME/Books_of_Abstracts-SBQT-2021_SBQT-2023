The Brazilian Symposium of Theoretical Chemistry (Simpósio Brasileiro de Química Teórica, SBQT) takes place every two years in different regions of Brazil. For over 40 years, it has been the prime event of the Brazilian Theoretical Chemistry community.

In this repository, you will find the books of abstracts of the SBQT 2021 and SBQT 2023. Enjoy them!
