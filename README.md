The Brazilian Symposium on Theoretical Chemistry (from the Portuguese, Simpósio Brasileiro de Química Teórica, SBQT) takes place every two years and
promotes the face-to-face meeting of the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry community.

In this repository, you will find the books of abstracts published during the SBQT 2021 and 2023.

We hope the reader will not only enjoy the reading but also profit from its contents.

Best wishes from the Theoretical Chemistry Group at the Military Institute of Engineering (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil).

Cheers!
